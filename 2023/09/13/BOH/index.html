<p>  Across the evening sea to Noon - for so long a city of Long, and now a city of song. Each day the ivory towers rise a little higher. ‘Noon, they say, is not as it was.’ But now we hear on the wind what Noon could become. I have found that old lost music… and the Hours of the Roost take up the refrain.</p>
<p>  穿过夜海方可抵达午港，那里曾是长生者的市城，而如今它已萦绕着歌声。象牙塔每日都会攀升。“午港，他们说，已经不再是曾经的样子。”但我们现在可从风中听闻到午港的未来之路。我已找到遗失的古老音乐。。。而鸟栖之时则是我的副歌。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Magnate Victory: Peace at Noon 富翁胜利：午港的平静<br>  Port Noon, across the evening sea. It’s long been a place for Long, and now it’s something more. Each day more of us arrive. The waves take our name as once the fountain did. The towers rise day by day. Here in the City’s shade, there will be peace.</p>
<p>  午港，仅有穿过夜海方可达到。它一直以来都是长生者的属地，而今它有了更多。如我们一般的人不分昼夜地来到此地。浪潮吞没了我们的名字，正如喷泉曾所做的那样。高塔拔地而起，高度与日俱增。在城市的阴影里，我们会将得到宁静。</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Winds of Noon 午港之风</p>
<p>  ‘Noon, they say, is not as it was.’ But Noon, with its towers of ivory, its wheels of shining iron, is becoming something more.</p>
<p>  “午港，他们说，已不再如往昔。”即便有着象牙塔与钢铁之轮，午港正在变成某些东西。</p>

<p>  ‘The houses are white and the hills are green and the air is golden and the sea won’t settle on one colour….’ That’s still true. But all the colours grow pale. The towers of ivory will rise higher day by day. One day, they’ll be complete. Until then, I’ll know peace; and when they’re complete, it won’t matter any more.</p>
<p>  “房屋居白而山岭持绿，天空显金但海无定色。。。” 以上所述依然不假。但那些色彩都在渐渐黯淡。象牙塔将日日升高。有朝一日，他们会完成的。那日若至，我将知晓平静，而无事将扰。</p>

<pre><code>        Across the evening sea. Ever since the Spring of the Witness rose from the earth, Port Noon has been a place for the ones who defy endings. Now, as the ivory towers rise, it&#39;s a place for those who accept them. In the end, that&#39;ll be all of us.

        跨过夜海。自从见证之泉于泥土中迸发之时，午港就已经属于那些反抗注定结局之人。如今，随着象牙塔的升起，它属于那些接纳他们的人。最终，那会是我们全部。

    - Revolutionary Victory: Revolutions at Noon 革命家胜利：午港革命

        Across the evening sea. The day the Cross came, the sky above Port Noon was dark with returning wings, and the sea boiled with their shapes. The residents took a while to come around to it. But Noon has always been a place outside the rule of the Hours, before all else;  as the Carapace-spires of horn and ivory rise above the new City, it can become a place of defiance.

        跨过夜海。介壳种于那日降临，回归的羽翼遮蔽了午港的天空，大海因他们的样貌而沸腾。居民暂耗时日才明白此事。但最重要的是午港自始至终都不受司辰权柄的束缚。当甲壳的角与象牙塔升起于新城之时，它将成为反抗之地

    - Executioner Victory: Sanctuary at Noon 行刑者胜利：于午港的避难所

        Across the evening sea. The day the Cross came, the sky above Port Noon was dark with returning wings, and the sea boiled with their shapes. The residents took a while to come around to it. But Noon has always been a sanctuary before all else; and now, as the Carapace-spires of horn and ivory rise above the new City, it&#39;s a sanctuary for them, too.

        跨过夜海。介壳种于那日降临，回归的羽翼遮蔽了午港的天空，大海因他们的样貌而沸腾。居民暂耗时日才明白此事。但最重要的是午港自始至终都是避难所；当甲壳的角与象牙塔升起于新城之时，它将也成为他们的避难所

    - Advent at Noon 午港的降临节

        Across the evening sea. The day the Cross came, the sky above Port Noon was dark with returning wings, and the sea boiled with their shapes.  Now, as the Carapace-spires of horn and ivory rise above the new City, Noon is different; for good, or for ill, but not forever.

        跨过夜海。介壳种于那日降临，回归的羽翼遮蔽了午港的天空，大海因他们的样貌而沸腾。当甲壳的角与象牙塔升起于新城之时，午港将异于往昔；或好，或坏，但不会永恒。

<p>  I had never thought we would pass beyond the wave to Ys - never thought we would walk its amber-shining cobbles and breathe its golden waters - never thought we would see the fortresses of orichalcum rise, day by day, to become something more than a City. But the world is changing, and when we have changed enough, this will be our home.</p>
<p>  我从未想过我们会渡过浪潮吞没之城的波涛，不曾想会踏于其琥珀原石，呼吸其金色海水，也没期望会将目睹山铜工厂日复一日地发展，最终超越城市。但世界正在改变，而当我们改变的够多之时，这里将是我们的家</p>

<li><p>Symurgist Victory: The Tapestry of Serpents 鸟语学家胜利：耶梦加得之毯</p>
<p>  Seven-Coils: mother of monsters, scaled queen… first weaver? Before the bird, the serpent; before the feather, the scale; before the knot, the nest. In each Coil-spawn, a mote of her remains; when they complete their matrix, we will know her Song.</p>
<p>  七蟠乃是千万异兽之母，也是遍身鳞甲之王。。。抑或是，第一位编织者？在鸟类征服天空之前，蛇蜿蜒扭曲于大地之上；在羽毛带来自由之前，鳞片护卫我们于危险之中；在伤疤护民官之前，七蟠居于其位。每个七蟠的子嗣中，都有她的一片碎片。我们将聆听她的圣歌，在他们完成应尽之责之后。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cartographer Victory: The Tapestry of Ways 地图测绘师胜利：道路编织成毯</p>
<p>  Sacrifice hair; sacrifice history. Untie a knot; break a testament. The passages of the Mansus are a labyrinth, and every labyrinth is its own answer. At the labyrinth’s heart waits an old-new god. If I follow its call… if I trace my paths on skin and paper… I’ll have my map.</p>
<p>  脱去毛发以博得关注，献祭历史以取悦司辰。解开道路编织成的金线，摧毁时间留存下的痕迹。漫宿的道路有如迷宫，而每条道路都有其答案。存于新旧之间之神居于漫宿正中。。。若我躬身于他的呼唤。。。若我紧随我的道路于皮肤与羊皮纸之上。。。我将拥有自己的地图。</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Eternal Tapestry 永恒历史之毯</p>
<p>  Find them in corners, find them in stories, find them in the edges of the sky. Little miracles like starred vipers, like thorned anemones, like nests of silk. All one piece, and all renewed, far beneath the notice of the Hours. But colours come back to the ochred earth.</p>
<p>  他们藏身于角落之中，他们躲藏在历史故事的缝隙之中，他们傍身在天空利刃般的边缘之中，他们却始终在我眼中。渺小的奇迹如带星的毒蛇般可遇而不可求，如带刺的风花一般可远观不可亵玩，如丝绸的巢穴般光鲜亮丽。一切重归于一，而一切悄然重启，远在司辰的视线之外。而颜色最终将回归于赭色的大地之上。</p>

<p>  七蟠能否从伤疤中钻出？飞蛾会否扭曲转动化为转轮？浪潮可否重新饮干赤杯？新与旧之神的战争天平会落向何方？不日，司辰会做出决定，一如他们曾经做的那样。但在一切重归有序之前，无序将庇护我于危险之外。</p>

<li><p>Numen: the Paths of the Sun</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cartographer Victory: Resolution</p>
<p>  The Mansus-paths pulse with light. Every mirror is an eye. The world awakens… but all this is nothing to me. The Mansus is illuminated. My Map is complete, perfect in every detail, and it charts the road to Dawn.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Twiceborn Victory: A Solar Alloy</p>
<p>  The New King’s foundries and glassworks roar with light. I haven’t been near, but even at this distance their light stains the sky. The Paths of the Sun open both ways… and down those Paths, Glory will flow like mercury, to take possession of its altars. The new order of the Mansus will permit no devouring of errant Long or anyone else. It seems almost quaint that I used to worry about that sort of thing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Mercury Flower</p>
<p>  The New King’s foundries and glassworks roar with light. I haven’t been near, but even at this distance their light stains the sky. The Paths of the Sun open both ways… and down those Paths, Glory will flow like mercury, to blossom in its hundred altars. Dawn is coming.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Numen: a Merciless Alteration</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Artist Victory: All the Colours, and More</p>
<p>  The New King’s foundries and glassworks roar with light. I begged a visit. I wasn’t disappointed. I can see the colours of Eternity in those fires. Those colours will kindle a hundred windows. Dawn will come. All I have to do is make absolutely certain that my part in it is known.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Archaeologist Victory: Born Among Colours</p>
<p>  The New King’s foundries and glassworks roar with light. It’s autumn, but already the nights are in retreat. Across the kingdom they’re setting up altars of glass and steel. Dawn will kindle in the altar-depths, and I’ll open my arms to its colours. My shadow will leave me; and then at last I’ll know which me I am.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Triumph of Hope</p>
<p>  The New King’s foundries and glassworks roar with light. It’s autumn, but already the nights are in retreat. Every evening the streets are filled with patriots and sceptics alike, jostling, joking, marvelling. Dawn is coming. A new Age. It might even be better than the last one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Numen: the Bells of Ys</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Revolutionary Victory: The New Names</p>
<p>  The New King’s foundries and workshops quiver with life. The songs of the foundry-Names ring out across the sky. When Dawn comes, the King has promised there will be no war in Europe. The foundries concur… but also they promise a victory. I understand this paradox. There will be a war… but not against our earthly enemies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prodigal Victory: The New Weapons</p>
<p>  The New King’s foundries and workshops quiver with life. The songs of the foundry-Names ring out across the sky. When Dawn comes, the King has promised there will be no war in Europe. The foundries concur… but also they promise a victory. I’ll leave others to resolve that paradox. My weapon chimes softly in my hand. Let my pursuers come.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A New Age</p>
<p>  The New King’s foundries and workshops quiver with life. The songs of the foundry-Names ring out across the sky. When Dawn comes, the King has promised there will be no war in Europe. The foundries concur… but also they promise a victory. In this new Age, perhaps this will no longer be a paradox.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Magnate Victory: A Gentler Sun</p>
<p>  The skies will be softer, the winds warmer. As we were born from the Shell, so the Red Sun will hatch, but gently. Each day it will accept a little - a very little- of our blood… and each night it will protect us. I can understand the consternation. I can understand the unkind turns of phrase. But it’s much gentler to have a Sun that knows you; that every sunrise, honours you with its own blood; that every evening, offers peace.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Symurgist Victory: A Kinder Sun</p>
<p>  The skies will be softer, the winds warmer. As we were born from the Shell, so the Red Sun will hatch, but gently. Each day it will accept a little - a very little- of our blood… and each night it will protect us. As it goes down into evening, as it rises in the morning, it will remember us in song. That song will be the one I have yearned for, and its rhythm the beat of my own heart.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Hungrier Heaven</p>
<p>  The skies will be softer, the winds warmer. As we were born from the Shell, so the Red Sun will hatch, but gently.

</li>
<li><p>Numen: Inescapable Confinement</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prodigal Victory: A Sun that Knows Us</p>
<p>  When once the Watchman is caged in shadows, the Sun will harden like spring ice, until - as we were born from the Shell - so the Red Sun will hatch, but gently. Each day it will accept a little - a very little - of our blood… I balk at that. I admit it. But a Sun that knows our taste is a kinder sun. I am quite certain that it will not eat me. And, once my pursuers are confined, neither will anything else.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Archaeologist Victory: Beneath a Sheltering Sun</p>
<p>  When once the Wolf-Divided is caged in light, the Sun will harden like spring ice, until - as we were born from the Shell - so the Red Sun will hatch, but gently. Each day it will accept a little - a very little - of our blood… and each night it will protect us. As it goes down into evening, as it rises in the morning, it will remember us in song. I will never be pure of my corruption. But the Red Sun won’t trouble himself over it… and so neither will I.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Cage of Light</p>
<p>  When once the Wolf-Divided is caged in light, the Sun will harden like spring ice, until - as we were born from the Shell - so the Red Sun will hatch, but gently.

<li><p>Revolutionary Victory: Revolution in Red</p>
<p>  The Watchman’s Tree has a Black Flower, but the Red Sun cannot be forgotten. It has a White, but his light runs red on snow. It has a Red Flower, but in this History, when the Sanguine Exception is invoked, the Red Flower will close its petals. And the Red Sun will hatch, but gently. Each day it will accept a little - a very little- of our blood… and each night it will protect us. As it goes down into evening, as it rises in the morning, it will remember us in song… a song that even the Calyptra cannot silence.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cartographer Victory: Charting the Dawn</p>
<p>  Very soon, the King will begin his royal progress. By day he’ll travel the roads of Britain. By night, he’ll walk the Paths of the Sun. Herald-Names will cry the Dawn before him, until every vein of the Mansus flushes with light, like a rose with golden ink; and at last I will complete my Map.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Twiceborn Victory: Royal Prerogatives</p>
<p>  Very soon, the King will begin his royal progress. By day he’ll travel the roads of Britain. By night, he’ll walk the Paths of the Sun. Herald-Names will cry the Dawn before him; and I will walk among them, inviolate under the protection of the Dawn-King.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The New King’s Path</p>
<p>  Very soon, the King will begin his royal progress. By day he’ll travel the roads of Britain. By night, he’ll walk the Paths of the Sun. Herald-Names will cry the Dawn before him, until Eternity’s light colours every Mansus-stone, like cinnabar, like mercury, like gold.</p>

<li><p>Numen: The Sun’s Weakness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Executioner Victory: The Sun’s Sins</p>
<p>  It was not an easy matter, the healing of the scars of the Sun. The king took the greatest into his own flesh, and so we see him now only twice each year, at winter and at spring. But sometimes pain teaches mercy. The days are bright as the King’s coin, but the nights fizz with song. Little jewelled lives, little hungry plants, tide-fruit and coil-spawn, all of it will thrive in the secret night. If any part of this is mine, then I have made amends.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Sun’s Scars</p>
<p>  It was not an easy matter, the healing of the scars of the Sun. The king took the greatest into his own flesh, and so we see him now only twice each year, at winter and at spring. But we love him so. And we have the Dawn.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Numen: the Great Counterfeit</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Twiceborn Victory: The Realm of Gold</p>
<p>  The Mansus has grown bright as brass. Is this the Second Dawn? A Golden Age? History’s last throes? Perhaps all those things, perhaps none, but in this New Order, under Light’s Law, I am safe, I am warm, I am home.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Coin of the Realm</p>
<p>  Each day in the New Kingdom gleams like a gold coin. Is this the Second Dawn? A Brass Age? Eternity’s penumbra? We are warm and fed; the King is wise and just; the skies are clear and bright; all’s well.</p>

<p>  Corresponding tarot: The Tower</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Revolutionary Victory: Calyptra at Twilight</p>
<p>  Speech was the weapon that won our first war. This Bell is the weapon that will win our last. The night-storms come and go with their violent colours and their violent rains. When all the skies are empty and all the Hours are spent, Eternity’s tyranny will fall.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prodigal Victory: The Eye of the Storm</p>
<p>  STRIKE THE HOURS. In the bright shadows of heaven’s war, I’m safe as a butterfly at a cyclone’s heart. And when earth and sky break open, what treasures will we find within?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Time’s Furnace</p>
<p>  STRIKE THE HOURS. History blazes bright. Eternity retreats. The sky will shake, the earth will break, and what treasures will that reveal?</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Numen: an Irresistable Feast</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Artist Victory: An Art of War</p>
<p>  I wish I could see it up close - the rents, the daubs, the fires. But it’s enough that it’s projected on the sky. A free entertainment! The Devouring War! For all to enjoy!</p>
</li>
<li><p>No Stars</p>
<p>  This has been the longest night. Even the stars have deserted us. The air grows stale and chill. But the ground trembles beneath us, and so I know the war goes on, and the Dawn is coming soon.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Numen: a Merciless Alteration</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Artist Victory: Colours’ End</p>
<p>  The world is a candle! The flame bends and gutters with the workings of the war. I had never imagined the colours! They will thank me for it. And the Dawn will come, of course; but I’ll miss the candle’s light.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Archaeologist Victory: Shadows’ End</p>
<p>  The Dawn is almost here… but already the War has set the shadows alight. My thoughts are kindled, too. I don’t know what will be left of me when the Dawn comes… but it’ll be something that does not regret.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mercy’s End</p>
<p>  When the war in the sky is over, when the earth is still, when the last Hour raises her voice, when the Dawn is here, we’ll say: this was necessary.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Numen: A Final Understanding</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Magnate Victory: The Whitest Flower</p>
<p>  ‘Speech is a wound,’ Husher famously insisted. Of silence, he said nothing at all. But then, of course, I suppose, he wouldn’t.</p>
<p>  It’s enough. I’m tired. What is written is written, and my contribution comes after this mark.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Lights Along The Way</p>
<p>  Julian Coseley, the anarchist, Eternity’s enemy. What convinced him, in the end, that Husher had any kind of point? The paradox of the eternal ending? The colours too pale for sight? Was it the secrets he saw in Ninegala’s paintings? His defeats? The quenching of his arrogance? Or just the length of his long long life? Why Silence? If that’s a question, Silence always has an answer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Numen: Inescapable Confinement</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prodigal Victory: A Cage of Visions</p>
<p>  This is the cell the Watchman built in the southmost reaches of the world, where the sea grows hard as horn and the sunset pale as snow. When the sunset comes, it will be his cell. Without the Watchman, there will be no Second Dawn… and without the Watchman, my pursuers will lose their force. A little light in the world is a small price to pay. After all, without the Watchman, there’ll be a little more mercy, too.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Archaeologist Victory: A Cage of Stars</p>
<p>  This is the cell the Watchman built for the Wolf-Divided, in the southmost reaches of the world, where the sea grows hard as horn and the sunset pale as snow. When the sunset comes, it will be his cell. Without the Wolf, we will see no Second Dawn. There may - there just may - be other benefits beside. No more Wolf-Splinters, for one. Is that my shadow? Or is it, finally, me? Let’s say it’s not. Let’s say I’m free..</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Cage of Snows</p>
<p>  This is the cell the Watchman built in the southmost reaches of the world, where the sea grows hard as horn and the sunset pale as snow. When the sunset comes, it will be his cell. Without the Watchman, there will be no Second Dawn. ‘He navigates; he illuminates; he is not compassionate…’ Perhaps when night falls, we’ll finally see a little compassion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Numen: Back Into Balance</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Executioner Victory: Robin in the Snow</p>
<p>  The Carapace Cross is gone. Into earth; into flesh; and the travelling-kinds,beyond wave and sky. They are very few now under the earth, and the Cross-in-flesh are us - some of us, at least. But when the travelling-kinds return, their wings will darken the sky; and in this history, they will be safe from any Dawn.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Revolutionary Victory: Frost</p>
<p>  Safe from any Second Dawn - In streets at night - in spires by day - crawling on the roofs of moving trains - buzzing in factory chimneys - the kinds of the Cross return. Of course they’ll frighten the wits out of everyone - everyone! But the Calyptra’s law doesn’t bind the Cross. When they’re ready to speak, and we’re ready to listen - to the hybrids in our sky, and the echo in our flesh - the tyranny of Eternity, at long last, will approach its resolution.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Closing a Wound</p>
<p>  The Cross died not passed within.’ When the travelling-kinds of the Carapace Cross return, how many of us will answer the heart-lifting buzz of their call? One in every thousand? One in every ten? There will be no Second Dawn - the Cross will walk among us - and when the wing-buzz, the heart-shrill, the star-song, goes out, when we are called to travel again beyond the sky - how many of us will go with them?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>“UNIQUE” ENDINGS</p>
<p>  As you can remember, Book of Hours has 101 endings, but these were only 99 of them. That’s because the remaining two are “unique” or “secret” endings, and neither of them can be achieved by standard means of recording a history. Instead, as their name implies, each of them has it’s own, unique method of obtaining.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hidden ending</p>
<p>  Winter or Pale ending is one of two unique endings of the game. It is represented by Ace of Swords tarot card. It is considered to be the true ending of Book of Hours.</p>
<p>  To achieve it, you have to make the the determination white, the first flower. afterward, wait for the winter season, and then go to The Tree. Present your Journal with one of your Elements of the Soul to get the ending. Note that it will only work if these two cards combined have no less than 3 of Winter aspect. If done correctly, the following ending will appear:</p>
<p>  A Knowledge In The Look Of Things</p>
<p>  ‘After the red leaf and the gold have gone,</p>
<p>  Brought down by the wind, then by hammering rain…</p>
<p>  …I speak to you now with the land’s voice,</p>
<p>  It is the cold, wild land that says to you</p>
<p>  A knowledge glimmers in the sleep of things:</p>
<p>  The old hills hunch before the north wind blows.’</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Howard Nemerov, 1920-1991, from ‘A Spell Before Winter’.</p>
<p>[You have completed a hidden ending. An argument has been made that this is the true ending of BOOK OF HOURS.]</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Best ending<br>  Evening or Enigmatic ending is one of two unique endings of the game. It is represented by Ace of Cups tarot card. It is considered to be the best ending of Book of Hours.</p>
<p>  In order to get it, you must record no history at all. While not having any history recorded in your journal, use it with any of the Elements of the Soul at The Tree to get the ending. Note that it can be done in any season. The ending itself is located just below this text.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Evening Falls</p>
<p>  I have my fire, my books, my clock, my window on the world where they do other things; and I am happy. This is the life I chose. The years will pass, like sun, like snow, like rain, like a gull’s wing beating, and when I close my eyes, they will find me smiling.</p>
