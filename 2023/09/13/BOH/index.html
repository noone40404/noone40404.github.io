<li><p>Numen: That Old Lost Music 回忆：遗失于时间中的音乐</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Symurgist Victory: Songs at Noon 鸟语学家胜利：正午之歌</p>
<p>  Across the evening sea to Noon - for so long a city of Long, and now a city of song. Each day the ivory towers rise a little higher. ‘Noon, they say, is not as it was.’ But now we hear on the wind what Noon could become. I have found that old lost music… and the Hours of the Roost take up the refrain.</p>
<p>  穿过夜海方可抵达午港，那曾是长生者的城市，而如今它已</p>
</li>
<li><p>Magnate Victory: Peace at Noon</p>
<p>  Port Noon, across the evening sea. It’s long been a place for Long, and now it’s something more. Each day more of us arrive. The waves take our name as once the fountain did. The towers rise day by day. Here in the City’s shade, there will be peace.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Winds of Noon</p>
<p>  ‘Noon, they say, is not as it was.’ But Noon, with its towers of ivory, its wheels of shining iron, is becoming something more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Numen: A Final Understanding</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Magnate Victory: Silence at Noon</p>
<p>  ‘The houses are white and the hills are green and the air is golden and the sea won’t settle on one colour….’ That’s still true. But all the colours grow pale. The towers of ivory will rise higher day by day. One day, they’ll be complete. Until then, I’ll know peace; and when they’re complete, it won’t matter any more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Last City, Noon</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>        Across the evening sea. Ever since the Spring of the Witness rose from the earth, Port Noon has been a place for the ones who defy endings. Now, as the ivory towers rise, it&#39;s a place for those who accept them. In the end, that&#39;ll be all of us.

- Numen: Back Into Balance


    - Revolutionary Victory: Revolutions at Noon

        Across the evening sea. The day the Cross came, the sky above Port Noon was dark with returning wings, and the sea boiled with their shapes. The residents took a while to come around to it. But Noon has always been a place outside the rule of the Hours, before all else;  as the Carapace-spires of horn and ivory rise above the new City, it can become a place of defiance.

    - Executioner Victory: Sanctuary at Noon

        Across the evening sea. The day the Cross came, the sky above Port Noon was dark with returning wings, and the sea boiled with their shapes. The residents took a while to come around to it. But Noon has always been a sanctuary before all else; and now, as the Carapace-spires of horn and ivory rise above the new City, it&#39;s a sanctuary for them, too.

    - Advent at Noon

        Across the evening sea. The day the Cross came, the sky above Port Noon was dark with returning wings, and the sea boiled with their shapes.  Now, as the Carapace-spires of horn and ivory rise above the new City, Noon is different; for good, or for ill, but not forever.

<p>  Corresponding tarot - The Fool</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Numen: Three Rules</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Revolutionary Victory: The Revolution in the Heart</p>
<p>  We are citizens of a republic we’ll never see. Our walls are paper and our rivers are only ink. But we are the children of History. Let Eternity tremble!</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Republic of Solitude</p>
<p>  All of of us who search out secrets are lonely. Our only home is a city we’ll never see. But in Eternity or History, we’re still its citizens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Numen: Loopholes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Twiceborn Victory: The Sanctuary Never</p>
<p>  By day I walk in the world, by night in the Mansus, but wherever I go, I walk the streets of the City Never. I am a servant of its laws, a subject of its kingless throne. The laws of others cannot touch me; and I am not alone.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A City Built on Paradox</p>
<p>  The City Never is founded on the rocks of paradox; its walls are paper; its rivers are ink. I am a servant of the City Never’s laws, a subject of its kingless throne; and I am not alone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Numen: The Sun’s Weakness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Executioner Victory: A City of Shadows</p>
<p>  Everything that occurs must dwell in History; everything that dwells in History will some day be bleached into the light of Eternity. But even Eternity’s light casts shadows - and those shadows mark the boundaries of our paradoxical, penumbral home.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A City Outside Eternity</p>
<p>  Everything that occurs must dwell in History; everything that dwells in History will some day be bleached into the light of Eternity. But even Eternity’s light casts shadows; and in that penumbral sanctuary, we who are citizens of Never will find our home.</p>

<li><p>ROSE ENDINGS</p>
<p>  Corresponding tarot - The World</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Numen: the Bells of Ys</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Revolutionary Victory: When the Hours Tremble</p>
<p>  I had never thought we would pass beyond the wave to Ys - never thought we would walk its amber-shining cobbles and breathe its golden waters - never thought we would see the manufactories of orichalcum rise, day by day, towards the final City’s plan. And I had never thought I would raise an army there against the world I know. But Eternity’s tyranny must end; Calyptra must fall.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prodigal Victory: Beneath the Hand of Ys</p>
<p>  I had never thought we would pass beyond the wave to Ys - never thought we would walk its amber-shining cobbles and breathe its golden waters - never thought we would see the sanctuaries of orichalcum rise, day by day, towards the future. Ys is not kind. But it is safe; and it will be home.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bells Beyond the Wave</p>
<p>  I had never thought we would pass beyond the wave to Ys - never thought we would walk its amber-shining cobbles and breathe its golden waters - never thought we would see the fortresses of orichalcum rise, day by day, to become something more than a City. But the world is changing, and when we have changed enough, this will be our home.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Numen: That Old Lost Music</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Magnate Victory: Peace Beyond the Wave</p>
<p>  Ys, with its ever-shifting light and its amber-shining cobbles, with its canals of coral and its temples of ice. It is so far from what we had known. But at evening, when the bells of Ys fall silent, there is peace here.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Symurgist Victory: The Songs of Ys</p>
<p>  Ys, with its ever-shifting light and its amber-shining cobbles, with its canals of coral and its temples of ice… we speak of it as a city, but Ys has no walls, and so it is no city. Not yet. With the bells of Ys, we will build those walls of song; and I will dwell in that music I have longed for.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ys Beyond the Wave</p>
<p>  Ys, with its ever-shifting light and its amber-shining cobbles, with its canals of coral and its temples of ice… we speak of it as a city, but Ys has no walls, and so it is no city. Not yet. We will build those walls of song.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Numen: A Final Understanding</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Magnate Victory: Peace, At Last</p>
<p>  Ys, with its ever-shifting light and its amber-shining cobbles, with its canals of coral and its temples of ice. When we have built the walls of Ys, it will be a city at last. In fact, it will be the last city. In that long decline to evening, I’ll know peace.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At Last, Ys</p>
<p>  Ys, with its ever-shifting light and its amber-shining cobbles, with its canals of coral and its temples of ice. When we have built the walls of Ys, it will be a city at last. In fact, it will be the City of Conclusions: the place that all the threads of History at last resolve to one.</p>

<p>  Corresponding tarot - The Moon</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Numen: the Great Counterfeit</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Twiceborn Victory: A Shadowed Sanctuary</p>
<p>  As within; so without. Brancrug, once the grey rock in the sea where the Cross first met Flint; now the flinty proxy of the black sapphire City that will rise endlessly into night, in the other-place we call the House of the Moon. There I will be welcome, and there I will be safe.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It Ends In Moonlight</p>
<p>  As within; so without. Brancrug, once the grey rock in the sea where the Cross first met Flint; now the flinty proxy of the black sapphire City that will rise endlessly into night, in the other-place we call the House of the Moon. No-one will inscribe my name above the gate; but I will keep the knowledge like a jewel beneath my tongue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Numen: Loopholes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Twiceborn Victory: To Sanctuary</p>
<p>  Through the Loopholes the citizens will pass, to raise a city of black sapphire where the Wheel still turns in the Moon’s house. No-one will ever see the place with waking eyes, but there I will dwell between sleep and life, and there, at last, I will be safe.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Moonlit City</p>
<p>  Through the Loopholes the citizens will pass, to raise a city of black sapphire where the Wheel still turns in the Moon’s house. No-one will ever see the place with waking eyes, and no-one will inscribe my name above the gate. But I will keep the knowledge like a jewel beneath my tongue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Numen: Weaving the World</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Symurgist Victory: The Songs of the House of the Moon</p>
<p>  Silver, the Moon’s tongue. Silver, the road’s blood. The birdsong notes, gleaming like black sapphire… this is the City in the world’s shadow, and here we will welcome the aviform Hours, to raise their song beneath the turning Wheel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cartographer Victory: The Hub of the Wheel</p>
<p>  The Mansus-paths cross like threads and meet like welcome strangers. Here at their nexus, at the hub of the Wheel that still turns beneath the invisible Moon, a city of black sapphire will rise; and at last, in the highest room of its highest tower, I will complete my map.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Home Beneath the Moon</p>
<p>  The Mansus-paths cross like threads and meet like welcome strangers. Here at their nexus, at the hub of the Wheel that still turns beneath the invisible Moon, the architects of dream and citizens of song will assemble behind the world; and they will raise a city of black sapphire, where all our arts will find their end.</p>

<p>  Every feast ends. When it does, some of the Hours will be sorry for what we did. Some will weep. Some will lick their lips and wonder what colours they’d find, each inside the other. This - this! - is my legacy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Gift of Stones</p>
<p>  ‘We’ll crack our teeth to break their stones. We’ll warm our fires to boil their bones. Their shining ribs will arc the sky; until into the fire we fly.’</p>

<li><p>Artist Victory: The First Fuel</p>
<p>  From stone, we will squeeze ripe-bursting diamonds! From bone, we will melt the drippingest light! From darkness, the most furious colours! A mountain of lights, a mountain of gifts, a feast to warm the world’s last age!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Archaeologist Victory: First at the Table</p>
<p>  Cats weave at my shoulders, rats wreathe my wrists. The table bands the world and the Hours sit at its head. I crouch beneath like the scavenger I am, but the bloody gods favour me - I feast on furry shadows - I am first at the feast.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Autumn-Come-Early</p>
<p>  It is the Hours that feast and the Names that wait upon them. No mortal is invited; few mortals will ever know. But the gobbets and tidbits of what was fall through the cracks into dream… and all our dreams are warm and fruitful. A ripe autumn for the world. A mellow sky, a sweet and smoky mist…</p>

<li><p>Executioner Victory: The Scar and the Savour</p>
<p>  ‘We are they who dream no dreams - singers of arising day…’ The poet-consul had it, and now I am Day’s consul. The Sun’s scars will keep him from the feast, but the Hours will pick clean the bones of Stone. My crimes will be erased… Or consumed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Old and the New</p>
<p>  It is the Hours that feast (all but the Sun, all but the gods-from-Light) and the Names that wait upon them. No mortal is invited; few mortals will ever know.

<li><p>Symurgist Victory: Sister to Echoes</p>
<p>  The Wheel’s membrane-pulses; the Flint’s facet-cries; the bell-tones of the Ambered Egg. We thought them lost to silence, but neither word nor song is ever entirely lost, except to Eternity. This is the memory that has not died.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cartographer Victory: Mother to Echoes</p>
<p>  The Gods-who-were-Stone walked the Mansus long before the Hours of Light, and they rarely troubled with eyes. Their songs entered the ways before them as messengers; the Mansus answered with echoes. She gave them their map before the first eye was opened, the first ink ground. It’ll be an aeon or three out of date… but it’ll give me what I need.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Daughter of Echoes</p>
<p>  In another age, Brancrug was the grey rock in the sea, the foothold where the Cross met Flint. Flint is gone; but her facets echoed each a separate Star. Walk by the waves in Brancrug Bay. Look up at the night sky. Watch for Flint.</p>

<li><p>Revolutionary Victory: The Fire in the Clouds</p>
<p>  When the Carapace-kinds departed, into earth and flesh, wave and sky, they carried the memories of lost Hours. Now, the proper steps have been taken for their return. I know because I see their fires in the sky; I know because I feel the revolution in my flesh.</p>

<p>  When the Carapace-kinds departed, into earth and flesh, wave and sky, they carried the memories of lost Hours. Now, the proper steps have been taken for their return.

<li><p>Revolutionary Victory: The First Defiance</p>
<p>  In the last days of the Gods-from-Stone, the seed of the Watchman’s Tree was planted. The Calyptra will preserve the tree, but they cannot uproot a second sapling. I will plant it on the beach beneath the closed horizon; I will water it with salt blood and salted sacrament; and the memory of the Gods-from-Stone will flower on its wounded skin. In quiet times, it will be a shelter, and in other times, perhaps a gallows-tree.</p>

<p>  This is the cell the Watchman built in the southmost reaches of the world, where the sea grows hard as horn and the sunset pale as snow. When the sunset comes, it will be his cell. He always knew he might be snared in ice, and when the waters rise, he will be free… but when the waters rise, the Egg will crack. No-one who serves the Sun on that day will be looking for me. They’ll all be looking for the last place to hide.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Archaeologist Victory: A Cage of Glass</p>
<p>  This is the cell the Sun-in-Rags built in the southmost reaches of the world, where the sea grows hard as horn and the sunset pale as mirrors. When the sunset comes, it will be his cell. He always knew he might be snared in glass, and when the earth contorts, he will be free… but when the earth contorts, it will be the coming anger of the Hour we call Flint. On that day, the one who walks with me will seek the safety of the cell. Whoever I am.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Cage of Scars</p>
<p>  This is the cell the Colonel built in the southmost reaches of the world, where the sea scabs over and the sunset pales to the colour of a fresh bandage. When the sunset comes, it will be his cell. He always knew he might be snared in scars, and when the world’s skin is healed, he will be free… but when the world’s skin is healed, so too will the Hour named Seven-Coils… and her children’s children will hear her screams.</p>

<li><p>Twiceborn Victory: The Consciousness of Blood</p>
<p>  The Chancel resolved that the Wheel is no Hour; that it might turn only in the House of the Moon. But the Meniscate favours the House of the Moon; the Horned-Axe obeys the Sanguine Exception; and the Sister-and-Witch do not divide what should be together. So the Wheel has returned to the waking world, and blood will run beneath its turnings. Safety will always have a price, for oneself or for others, and this is the price I have decided they will pay.</p>

<p>  The Wheel in the House of the Moon, the Flint in the memories of the sky, the Seven-Coils in her children… the Sun’s Paths, in the Sun’s arrogance, touched all these places. Along these paths, the anger of the forgotten gods will flow, like a river, like the pounding of the heart. Along all those paths the Flint will hang her facet-Stars like maps… and in their light, at last, I will map the Mansus.</p>

<p>  The Wheel in the House of the Moon, the Flint in the memories of the sky, the Seven-Coils in her children… the Sun’s Paths, in the Sun’s arrogance, touched all these places. Along these paths, the anger of the forgotten gods will flow, like a river, like the pounding of the heart.

</li>
<li><p>The Gods in the Heart</p>

<p>  Seven-Coils: mother of monsters, scaled queen… first weaver? Before the bird, the serpent; before the feather, the scale; before the knot, the nest. In each Coil-spawn, a mote of her remains; when they complete their matrix, we will know her Song.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cartographer Victory: The Tapestry of Ways</p>
<p>  Sacrifice hair; sacrifice history. Untie a knot; break a testament. The passages of the Mansus are a labyrinth, and every labyrinth is its own answer. At the labyrinth’s heart waits an old-new god. If I follow its call… if I trace my paths on skin and paper… I’ll have my map.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Eternal Tapestry</p>
<p>  Find them in corners, find them in stories, find them in the edges of the sky. Little miracles like starred vipers, like thorned anemones, like nests of silk. All one piece, and all renewed, far beneath the notice of the Hours. But colours come back to the ochred earth.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Twiceborn Victory: A Solar Alloy</p>
<p>  The New King’s foundries and glassworks roar with light. I haven’t been near, but even at this distance their light stains the sky. The Paths of the Sun open both ways… and down those Paths, Glory will flow like mercury, to take possession of its altars. The new order of the Mansus will permit no devouring of errant Long or anyone else. It seems almost quaint that I used to worry about that sort of thing.</p>

<p>  The New King’s foundries and glassworks roar with light. I haven’t been near, but even at this distance their light stains the sky. The Paths of the Sun open both ways… and down those Paths, Glory will flow like mercury, to blossom in its hundred altars. Dawn is coming.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Archaeologist Victory: Born Among Colours</p>
<p>  The New King’s foundries and glassworks roar with light. It’s autumn, but already the nights are in retreat. Across the kingdom they’re setting up altars of glass and steel. Dawn will kindle in the altar-depths, and I’ll open my arms to its colours. My shadow will leave me; and then at last I’ll know which me I am.</p>

<li><p>Numen: Back Into Balance</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Executioner Victory: Robin in the Snow</p>
<p>  The Carapace Cross is gone. Into earth; into flesh; and the travelling-kinds,beyond wave and sky. They are very few now under the earth, and the Cross-in-flesh are us - some of us, at least. But when the travelling-kinds return, their wings will darken the sky; and in this history, they will be safe from any Dawn.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Revolutionary Victory: Frost</p>
<p>  Safe from any Second Dawn - In streets at night - in spires by day - crawling on the roofs of moving trains - buzzing in factory chimneys - the kinds of the Cross return. Of course they’ll frighten the wits out of everyone - everyone! But the Calyptra’s law doesn’t bind the Cross. When they’re ready to speak, and we’re ready to listen - to the hybrids in our sky, and the echo in our flesh - the tyranny of Eternity, at long last, will approach its resolution.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Closing a Wound</p>
<p>  The Cross died not passed within.’ When the travelling-kinds of the Carapace Cross return, how many of us will answer the heart-lifting buzz of their call? One in every thousand? One in every ten? There will be no Second Dawn - the Cross will walk among us - and when the wing-buzz, the heart-shrill, the star-song, goes out, when we are called to travel again beyond the sky - how many of us will go with them?</p>

<li><p>“UNIQUE” ENDINGS</p>
<p>  As you can remember, Book of Hours has 101 endings, but these were only 99 of them. That’s because the remaining two are “unique” or “secret” endings, and neither of them can be achieved by standard means of recording a history. Instead, as their name implies, each of them has it’s own, unique method of obtaining.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hidden ending</p>
<p>  Winter or Pale ending is one of two unique endings of the game. It is represented by Ace of Swords tarot card. It is considered to be the true ending of Book of Hours.</p>
<p>  To achieve it, you have to make the the determination white, the first flower. afterward, wait for the winter season, and then go to The Tree. Present your Journal with one of your Elements of the Soul to get the ending. Note that it will only work if these two cards combined have no less than 3 of Winter aspect. If done correctly, the following ending will appear:</p>
<p>  A Knowledge In The Look Of Things</p>
<p>  ‘After the red leaf and the gold have gone,</p>
<p>  Brought down by the wind, then by hammering rain…</p>
<p>  …I speak to you now with the land’s voice,</p>
<p>  It is the cold, wild land that says to you</p>
<p>  A knowledge glimmers in the sleep of things:</p>
<p>  The old hills hunch before the north wind blows.’</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Howard Nemerov, 1920-1991, from ‘A Spell Before Winter’.</p>
<p>[You have completed a hidden ending. An argument has been made that this is the true ending of BOOK OF HOURS.]</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Best ending<br>  Evening or Enigmatic ending is one of two unique endings of the game. It is represented by Ace of Cups tarot card. It is considered to be the best ending of Book of Hours.</p>
<p>  In order to get it, you must record no history at all. While not having any history recorded in your journal, use it with any of the Elements of the Soul at The Tree to get the ending. Note that it can be done in any season. The ending itself is located just below this text.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Evening Falls</p>
<p>  I have my fire, my books, my clock, my window on the world where they do other things; and I am happy. This is the life I chose. The years will pass, like sun, like snow, like rain, like a gull’s wing beating, and when I close my eyes, they will find me smiling.</p>
